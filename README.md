<h1>Concept3D JS Challenge</h1>

This challenge is designed to give us a sense of your style as a programmer as well as your ability to solve problems.

We understand there are similiar challenges available on the internet, however please keep in mind that you could be asked about any line of code you submit and encourage you to solve this independently. Incomplete submissions are okay - we are interested in seeing your thought process.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

### Setup

Prerequisites: 
1. Have `npm` installed. [If you don't have npm, you can find instructions on installing it here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
2. Know what poker is. Find some rules [here](https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/games/rules/?no_redirect=1)
3. Make sure you are in the `challenge` directory. 
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependecies for this challenge. We are using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the test framework. 
5. At this point you should be able to run the command `npm test` and see one failing test in your terminal.

### Poker Hand Ranker

Write a JS class that will take in any poker hand, evaluate it and return its
rank.

Example:

Hand: As Ks Qs Js 10s (Royal Flush)

Hand: Ah As 10c 7d 6s (One Pair)

Hand: Kh Kc 3s 3h 2d (Two Pair)

Hand: Kh Qh 6h 2h 9h (Flush)

It should handle the following hand ranks:

- Royal Flush
- Straight Flush
- Four of a Kind
- Full House
- Flush
- Straight
- Three of a Kind
- Two Pair
- One Pair
- High Card

Please include test cases to cover all hands listed above and any additional edge cases you can think of.
